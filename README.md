Add support for [Postgres full text search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html)
to [diesel](https://diesel.rs/), the safe, extensible ORM and query builder for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This crate also serves as an example of how to extend diesel with database specific features
outside of diesel itself as third party crate.
